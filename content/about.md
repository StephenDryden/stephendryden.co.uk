Platform Engineer with 15 years of experience in the IT industry. Proven ability to deliver on high-quality, scalable, and reliable cloud-based platforms using AWS, Kubernetes and Terraform.

Outside of work youâ€™ll find me at the local bouldering wall, baking bread, playing video games, practising GoLang or walking my 4-legged colleague, Otis.
